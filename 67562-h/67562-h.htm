<span class="small">THE BEACH HILL NEIGHBORHOOD.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Would</span> you believe it, Mrs. Glenn,
the Tyrrell House is sold, and a family is
going to move into it right away? The
painters and carpenters have been there
for a week. I didn&#8217;t know the house, it
looked so lively. It seems too bad to
have that place shut up from the public,
for we all enjoyed it so much; but I suppose
the owner had the best right to it,
after all. I haven&#8217;t found out who the
family are, but I shall hear all about it
to-morrow, and then I will let you know;
for Aunt Prudence is going there to clean<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
the rooms, and get them ready for the
furniture.&#8221;</p>

<p>As Miss Letty paused to take breath,
I expressed my interest in the news,
which, to confess the truth, had affected
me rather unpleasantly.</p>

<p>The Tyrrell House was the &#8220;show-place&#8221;
of Beach Hill, a rambling, aristocratic
mansion, built by a wealthy Englishman,
who, after a series of domestic
troubles, shut up the house in disgust,
and left the country. It was his wish
that no one should reside there; consequently
the house was out of repair, and
the extensive grounds, laid out originally
by a landscape gardener, were overrun
with weeds. Still it was a lovely spot,
and the dwellers on the hill held annual
picnics there, and lovers strolled through
its shaded walks by moonlight, and altogether
we had come to look upon it as
public property, held for our special benefit.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
Great was our astonishment, therefore,
when we heard that the house had
been purchased, and was fitting up for a
family, who were to take immediate possession.
It was felt by us almost as a
personal loss; and woe to the new-comers,
should they fail to atone by the charms
of their society for the deprivation we
were to suffer.</p>

<p>Not that we were an inhospitable or
quarrelsome set of people. On the contrary,
we prided ourselves on the possession
of the opposite qualities. If there
were in the town of Woodbury a model
neighborhood, we believed it to be located
on Beach Hill. Ours was a very select
society, reckoning among its members
the clergyman, lawyer, doctor, and editor
of the town, and a number of gentlemen
of wealth and leisure, as well as
some who led the dubious sort of existence
called &#8220;living by one&#8217;s wits.&#8221; We<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
assumed, however, no airs of superiority
over our townsmen, but were content to
manifest our self-complacency by a quietly
patronizing manner whenever we
met them. In such a community as this,
it may be supposed the arrival of a new
family was quite an event, particularly as
they were about to occupy the best house
in the town.</p>

<p>The next day I was very busy at home,
and had forgotten the coming event, when
just at evening Miss Letty made her appearance,
every line of her face instinct
with news which her tongue was eager to
communicate.</p>

<p>Miss Letty Brown was the dressmaker
<i>par excellence</i> of the town of Woodbury;
and though we of the Hill had tried hard
to appropriate her, it was found an impossibility,
so we were fain to share her
services with the inhabitants of the village.
She was a cheerful, active little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
woman, of an uncertain age, with a fresh,
breezy atmosphere always about her,
which stirred one very pleasantly&mdash;a
little given to gossip, yet no scandal-monger,
but a sincere, earnest Christian,
loving God and her fellow-men, and looking
persistently on the bright side of every
thing. No matter how dark the day,
Miss Letty firmly believed in the sunshine
behind the clouds, and waited for
it to break through. Her services were
in constant requisition on every occasion;
and as she was brimming over with what
the Yankees call &#8220;faculty,&#8221; nothing that
skill and ingenuity could accomplish came
amiss to her.</p>

<p>Hardly was the neat white sun-bonnet
laid aside, when she exclaimed,</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, it&#8217;s really wonderful how things
do come about in this world. There&#8217;s
old Mr. Tyrrell thought he&#8217;d cut off his
daughter with a shilling, and now her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
grandson has come into possession of the
house and land.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How is that?&#8221; I asked; &#8220;is this new
family connected with the Tyrrells?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh yes; Aunt Prudence has told me
all about it. Mr. Fenton, the gentleman
who has bought the property, is the grandson
of Emily Tyrrell that was, and he
has lived in Alabama a great many years.
It seems he is a strong Union man; and
when this rebellion broke out, he got into
trouble, and has been all this time trying
to get away; and now the family have
come, but he stays behind to try and
save some more of his money. Mrs.
Fenton is very sick, and has been for a
great while; but there is a grown-up
daughter and another young lady, a
niece, who is said to be an heiress, and a
son, who I rather think is in the rebel
army, though there isn&#8217;t much said
about it.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>&#8220;Are the family coming immediately?&#8221;
I inquired, for Miss Letty&#8217;s account
had awakened my interest in these refugees
from rebel tyranny.</p>

<p>&#8220;They are expected every day, but
I&#8217;m sure the house is any thing but ready
for them. When I heard about the poor
sick lady, I felt like taking right hold
and putting things to rights; but it would
not have been taken kindly by Aunt
Prudence, so I held my tongue. Mrs.
Ryder and Mabel were there, seeing to
the furniture and pictures, for it seems
that when Mr. Ryder went south for his
health, three years ago, he got acquainted
with this family, and that is the way they
found out that the house was for sale and
got it. There was quite a company of
Beach Hill people there, and among
the rest Robert Lester, the fine-looking
young lawyer. I don&#8217;t often take a
fancy to young men&mdash;you needn&#8217;t smile,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
Nellie&mdash;but I do like that young man
wonderfully. There&#8217;s something so noble
about him; and yet he&#8217;s as gentle as
a woman.&#8221;</p>

<p>I assented cordially to Miss Letty&#8217;s
praise of the young lawyer, for he had
been a favorite of mine from his first appearance
in our town. He was alone in
the world, having no relatives but one
sister, who was at a boarding-school at
some distance from Woodbury. His legal
knowledge and splendid powers as a
speaker made him a marked man in the
community, and he was rising rapidly in
his profession, while his private character,
so pure and manly, won the esteem
and friendship of all.</p>

<p>Unlike too many young men, Mr. Lester
had not been ashamed to avow himself
a Christian by a public profession of
his faith in Jesus; and young as he was,
Mr. Ryder had found him an efficient<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
helper in every good word and work,
while even infidels and scoffers were compelled
to admire his consistency and firmness
of principle.</p>

<p>When the war broke out, and with
thousands of others the young men of
our village sprang to arms, we expected
Robert Lester would be one of the first
to go, for all knew his patriotic devotion
to the cause of liberty; but to our surprise
he did not enlist, though he looked
sad enough when the first company
marched away, carrying with them our
best wishes and prayers for their success.
He was not a man whom one would like
to question about his reasons for any
course of conduct, so we waited to hear
what he would say, but he said nothing.</p>

<p>The second company went, and still
no word from him, though his efforts to
promote the good cause were laborious
and incessant. There was some mystery<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
about it, for when urged to accept the
command of a company, he replied hastily,</p>

<p>&#8220;Do not ask it. I would give ten of
the best years of my life to be able to
say yes, but I cannot go. I can help to
send others, however, and that I am doing
with all my heart.&#8221;</p>

<p>In fact his purse was always open,
and as his fortune was large, the streams
of his benevolence flowed in various channels,
making glad many a heart which
the war had made desolate.</p>

<p>Mr. Ryder our excellent minister, Dr.
Goodhue our physician, and Mr. Reed,
a thin, pale young man, who edited the
Woodbury Chronicle, were all of opinion
that Mr. Lester had good reasons for
staying at home, and the rest of us were
satisfied to adopt their belief, though we
felt that he had lost a glorious opportunity
of becoming a hero.</p>

<p>Before leaving, Miss Letty informed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
me in confidence that the new family
were to be invited to the meeting of the
Soldiers&#8217; Aid Society at Mrs. Atlee&#8217;s,
and that then we should know whether
they sympathized with the government,
or were at heart secessionists.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not that I think there&#8217;s any doubt
about it,&#8221; she said; &#8220;for if they had
liked the rebellion, they could have
staid there, you know. But it&#8217;s always
best to have things clear, and it&#8217;s hard
to satisfy some people.&#8221;</p>

<p>This was a fact which could not be
denied, even in our neighborhood, and I
contented myself with inquiring if any
one besides Mr. Ryder had seen the
Fentons.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know, but I had my thoughts
about it, when I saw Mr. Lester looking
so sharp at the portraits of the family
which are hung up. There was one of a
young girl, the prettiest thing I ever set<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
eyes on; it was so beautiful it spoilt all
the rest. Her eyes were just like stars,
and such lovely curls of brown hair falling
over her white neck and shoulders;
but the sweet look on her face was better
than all. I&#8217;m sure I should love that
girl, and I guess Mr. Lester thought so
too, from the way he kept going back to
it again and again, as if he couldn&#8217;t get
away, looking all the while so melancholy.
One thing I&#8217;m sure of,&#8221; added
Miss Letty as she rose to go; &#8220;that
young man hasn&#8217;t got any thing to be
ashamed of; for if ever there was an honest
and brave soul looking out through a
face, his is the one, and I&#8217;d trust him
with the last cent I had in the world.&#8221;</p>

<p>With this emphatic declaration Miss
Letty took her leave, and the last I saw
of the white sun-bonnet, it was disappearing
among the shrubbery at the parsonage.</p>

<span class="small">THE SOLDIERS&#8217; AID SOCIETY.</span></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> new-comers were at length settled
in their pleasant home. The neighbors
had all called, and were received
with a courtesy and kindness which won
golden opinions from every one.</p>

<p>Mrs. Fenton was a confirmed invalid,
never leaving her apartment; but the
peace of God, which like a river flowed
through her soul, filled the room with sunshine.
In early life she had been a proud,
ambitious woman, valuing wealth and social
distinction above all things else, and
anxious only that her children should
shine in the circles of fashion to which she
belonged. But in the midst of her career
the hand of God was laid upon her, and
in the solitude of a sick-room she was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
forced to think. Through the prayers
and efforts of a faithful Christian friend
she was brought to look to Jesus for pardoning
and healing mercy, and after a
season of deep mental anguish, during
which all the waves and billows of divine
wrath seemed rolling over her, she found
refuge at last at the foot of the cross, and
was enabled to say from the heart, &#8220;I
know in whom I have believed.&#8221;</p>

<p>For ten years since that hour she had
been confined to her couch with a hopeless
disease, often racked with intense
agony, yet always the same patient, uncomplaining
sufferer, always calm and
happy, with a heart full of love and pity
for every form of human sorrow. By
her household she was looked upon as a
guardian spirit, rather than a helpless
dependent. Every disputed question
was referred to her decision, and whatever
storms invaded the domestic circle,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
&#8220;mother&#8217;s room&#8221; was always a place of
refuge, which seemed to her children the
dearest spot on earth.</p>

<p>Elinor Fenton the daughter was a delicate,
graceful girl, inheriting her mother&#8217;s
gentleness and refinement, but with
the shadow of a deep sorrow always visible
on her sweet face. That there was
a son we knew, but nothing was ever
said of him, and we could easily believe
that his desertion of the Union cause, the
uncertainty of her father&#8217;s fate, and the
illness of her mother, must exert a depressing
influence on one so young, even
before we heard the saddest part of her
story. The wealth of her affections had
been bestowed on one who seemed fully
worthy of them, but when the day of trial
came he was found wanting. He was
one of the first to enter the rebel army,
and his influence over young Fenton had
led the latter to adopt the same course.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
Thus doubly bereft of lover and brother,
the young girl devoted herself to her suffering
mother; but her heart was open
as the day &#8220;to melting charity,&#8221; and
none ever appealed to her in vain for
sympathy or relief.</p>

<p>When I first went to the house, I saw
only Mrs. Fenton and Elinor, but my interest
in both was so much excited that
the call was soon repeated, and on my
second visit Mrs. Fenton said to her
daughter,</p>

<p>&#8220;Elinor, where is your cousin? Go,
my love, and tell Lilian I wish to see her
here.&#8221;</p>

<p>Elinor left the room, and soon returned,
accompanied by a young girl whom
she introduced as Miss Grey, and in
whom I recognized the original of the
pleasing portrait I had seen. She was
indeed most attractive in face and person;
bright, sparkling, and intellectual,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
with a world of thought and feeling in
her full hazel eye, shaded by long silken
lashes, and an equal amount of firmness
and energy indicated by the finely moulded
mouth and chin.</p>

<p>After paying her respects to me as a
stranger, she seated herself on an ottoman
by the side of the couch, and taking
one thin, white hand of the invalid,
laid her cheek on it in a caressing way,
which was evidently the expression of a
tender and loving nature.</p>

<p>&#8220;And what has my Lilian been about
all the morning,&#8221; said Mrs. Fenton, &#8220;that
I have seen nothing of her before?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, dear aunt, I have been very busy,
I assure you. Venus wanted me in the
kitchen a while, for she was afraid her
preserves were in danger of spoiling.
Then I gave little Pete his daily lesson;
and last, not least, had to prepare some
work to take to the society to-morrow.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>&#8220;Then you are going to our meeting?&#8221;
I said; &#8220;I am very glad to hear that, for
somehow I feared we should not have
the pleasure of seeing you young ladies
there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You do not know our Lilian,&#8221; said
her aunt fondly, &#8220;or you would have no
doubts on such a subject. She is a perfect
enthusiast in the Union cause, and I
am afraid she has almost wished herself
capable of bearing arms in its defence.
However that may be, she honors a soldier
with all her heart, and would gladly
devote herself in any way to do him good.
As for my Elinor,&#8221; she added, turning
with a smile to her daughter, &#8220;she is no
less loyal than her cousin, though not
quite so demonstrative naturally, and
tied to a sick mother who can hardly
live without her. But you will see them
both to-morrow, for the cause is dear to
us all.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>When I left the house, Lilian Grey
accompanied me to the door, and taking
my hand, said with a frankness that was
very captivating,</p>

<p>&#8220;Mrs. Glenn, my aunt has taken a
great fancy to you; and if there were no
other reason, we should love you for that.
Now I want to ask as a great favor, that
you will take Elinor and myself under
your wing to-morrow, for we cannot help
dreading the battery of eyes and tongues
that we must encounter. I dare say you
are no worse here than other people, and
perhaps a great deal better, but as Venus
says, &#8216;There&#8217;s no accounting for human
nature,&#8217; and strangers usually have
to run the gauntlet in order to gain the
freedom of any country town.&#8221;</p>

<p>I kissed the fair cheek that was glowing
like a rose, and promised my best
services on the morrow.</p>

<p>There was a very full meeting of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
Soldiers&#8217; Aid Society, for it was hoped
that the strangers would attend, and all
were anxious to meet them. I went early,
and found Mrs. Ryder, our president, and
Miss Letty Brown busied in cutting and
fitting garments; while in the two rooms
needles and tongues were equally active.</p>

<p>It was not long before Miss Fenton
and her cousin came in, for they had
none of that petty pride which leads its
possessor to despise punctuality as a vulgar
virtue. They were both more plainly
dressed than most of the young ladies
present; but though simple and unaffected
in manner, there was an innate
dignity and refinement about them which
effectually repelled impertinence, and disappointed
a few who were prepared, in
their own elegant phraseology, &#8220;to find
out all about them.&#8221; There was one woman,
however, who was not to be foiled in
this determination.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>Mrs. Flint was the widow of a worthy
man, who is said to have been worried
out of existence by his disconsolate partner,
and none who knew her could question
the probability of such a catastrophe.
Her manner was always deprecating;
her step, true to her nature, was soft and
stealthy, and her voice carefully modulated
to express only amiability; but
there was a rigidity about the thin lips
and a sharp glitter in the cold blue eye
which told quite another story.</p>

<p>Greatly to the annoyance of our good
pastor and his wife, Mrs. Flint arrogated
to herself the office of adviser in all matters
relating to the church; and as she
could talk fluently, and call up tears from
some hidden fountain on all proper occasions,
some ignorant people looked on her
as quite a saint, while those who knew
her best regarded her as a scheming, dangerous
woman, the female counterpart of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
Bunyan&#8217;s Talkative. She had exerted
herself to the utmost to get the management
of the Society, and especially of its
funds, into her own hands; and failing
in this, had left us in disgust, and for
months had not attended our meetings,
until brought out by curiosity on the
present occasion.</p>

<p>Mabel Ryder had drawn Elinor away
into a circle of young ladies; but Lilian,
who had been consulting Miss Letty about
her work, was sitting alone, and to her
Mrs. Flint cautiously made her way.
After a few commonplace remarks, she
said in her softest tone, &#8220;I am very happy
to see you here, of course, but I hardly
expected that you Southerners would be
willing to help us fight against your own
brethren.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; was the spirited reply,
&#8220;whom you mean by my brethren.
I am an American, and love my whole<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
country and the dear old flag better than
my life. There is as much Northern
blood in my veins as Southern, and if it
were not so, I should feel just as I do
now. No one could be any thing to me
who wished to break up and destroy the
best government ever formed by man.
I never see a soldier who has fought for
his country without feeling as if I wished
to speak to him as a friend; and I count
it an honor to do any thing, no matter
how humble, that can add to his comfort.&#8221;</p>

<p>The dark eyes flashed and the red lips
trembled with the earnestness of her feelings;
and any one but Mrs. Flint would
have retired from the field; but she only
answered with perfect coolness,</p>

<p>&#8220;I admire your patriotism, but when
we think what a terrible thing war is,
and how many precious lives are thrown
away, we cannot help being willing to
do any thing for peace.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>&#8220;I do not consider war as the worst
of all evils,&#8221; replied Lilian, &#8220;dreadful as
it is. There are times in the history of
all nations, when liberty can only be preserved
by fighting for it, and I believe
God hates a guilty peace, even more than
the desolations of war. Storms are very
useful and salutary things,&#8221; she added
with a smile, &#8220;though they often make
sad havoc of property and life. None
can mourn more than I do the loss of
the glorious dead, who have fallen in the
cause of freedom; but it is far better to
die so than to live cowards or traitors.&#8221;</p>

<p>Clearly there was nothing to be made
out of Lilian Grey, and Mrs. Flint looked
about for Elinor; but Mabel Ryder was
on her guard, and gave no opportunity
for an attack in that direction. So our
Beach Hill diplomat was silent for a
time, but during the afternoon I heard
her in discussion with Miss Letty on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
some subject which seemed to interest
the latter very deeply. I only caught
the conclusion of Mrs. Flint&#8217;s remarks.
&#8220;Such things seem to me very singular,
to say the least.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m very thankful that I
haven&#8217;t the faculty of seeing singular
things that some folks seem to have. I
always thought that this was a land of liberty,
and that men could go into the army
and fight, or stay at home and help others
to go, just as they thought right, without
being called to an account for it. Mr.
Lester is able to take care of himself,
and doesn&#8217;t need my help; but I hate
this mousing round after characters, just
as if they were bits of cheese.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you must acknowledge,&#8221; answered
the purring voice again, &#8220;that there&#8217;s
a mystery about this young man, and
that is always against any one.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Fiddlesticks on your mystery. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
sha&#8217;n&#8217;t acknowledge any such thing. In
the first place, I don&#8217;t call every thing
a mystery that I can&#8217;t see through; for if
I did, there&#8217;d be no end of mysteries,
seeing I can understand but very little.
In the next place, supposing there is a
mystery, it may be a good one; for I suppose
there can be good mysteries as well
as bad ones in this world.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have been told on very good authority,&#8221;
persisted Mrs. Flint, &#8220;that Mr.
Lester has been much at the South, and
he may have his own private reasons for
not wishing to fight the rebels.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And if he has,&#8221; replied Miss Letty,
&#8220;I dare say they are honorable ones,
and if they satisfy him, I don&#8217;t see what
business &#8217;tis of ours. When I get a person
marked down in my book as pure
gold, I a&#8217;n&#8217;t always going over them with
a magnifying-glass to see if I can&#8217;t find
a flaw somewhere. If there are things<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
about them I don&#8217;t understand, I take it
for granted they&#8217;re of a piece with those
that I do understand, and so it never
troubles me a bit.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know he is a great favorite of yours,
and you can&#8217;t see any faults in him; but
for my part, I never had clear evidence
of his being a Christian.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And pray, what kind of evidence do
you want?&#8221; inquired Miss Letty, with more
asperity of tone than I had ever heard
from her before. &#8220;If humbly trusting in
Christ, feeding the hungry, clothing the
naked, and taking care of widows and orphans,
isn&#8217;t religion, what is? Mr. Lester
is always on hand when any thing good
is going forward in the church, though he
doesn&#8217;t pray at the corners of the streets,
like the Pharisees, nor say to everybody,
by his looks and actions, &#8216;See how good
I am.&#8217; I think though, that he follows
his Master a great deal nearer than some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
who try to make out that their little tallow
dip is a splendid Drummond light.
But bless me, Mrs. Flint, you&#8217;re sewing
that sleeve in wrong-side out. It wont
do to talk about our neighbors and sew
for the soldiers at the same time.&#8221;</p>

<p>With this home-thrust Miss Letty left
the room, while we all inwardly rejoiced
that Mrs. Flint had been silenced by one
whom she regarded as so greatly her inferior.</p>

<p>After tea all work was laid aside, and
the gentlemen one after another came in,
until the rooms were filled, and the evening
was spent in social enjoyment. It
was remarked by all that Robert Lester
and Miss Grey did not meet as strangers,
though there was evident constraint
in the manner of both. Lilian changed
color, and seemed about to retreat when
he approached her; and on his part,
though remarkable for his power of self-control,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
there was something in his appearance
none had ever seen before.
They had evidently known each other
previously, and met now on a different
footing from that of mere acquaintance.
A dozen pair of eyes were upon them,
and the situation was becoming embarrassing
enough, when Elinor Fenton came
to the rescue of her cousin, and entering
into conversation with Mr. Lester, drew
attention from Lilian, who took refuge
among a group of young persons surrounding
the piano.</p>

<p>When the company were about to separate,
I chanced to be in the dressing-room,
when as Lilian entered the hall I
heard Mr. Lester say to her,</p>

<p>&#8220;Lilian, will you not allow me to accompany
you home?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly not,&#8221; was the hasty reply;
&#8220;my aunt has sent the carriage for us,
and I prefer riding with Elinor.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>&#8220;Permit me at least to see you to the
carriage,&#8221; he said almost humbly, and I
felt hurt at her cold rejection of his offer.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is no necessity for it,&#8221; she said.
&#8220;Pete is here, and he is accustomed to
the duty.&#8221;</p>

<p>What could this mean? Of all the
young men I had ever known, I should
have selected Robert Lester as the one
best fitted to win the heart of such a
young lady as Lilian; yet she shunned
him and repelled his attentions. My
thoughts were painfully occupied with
the subject as I returned home, and in
my dreams that night the two were
strangely blended, though always with
some invisible barrier between them,
which I sought in vain to discover and
remove.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER III.<br />


<span class="small">THE DEPARTURE OF THE REGIMENT.</span></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Forts</span> Donalson and Henry had been
taken by our brave soldiers and seamen,
and the nation was in a fever of excitement
and joy. But recruits were wanted
to fill up the wasted armies in the various
departments, and the work of enlistment
went rapidly on among the young
men of our neighborhood, while mothers,
wives, and daughters worked day and
night to fit out the beloved ones who
were so soon to leave us for the seat of
war.</p>

<p>Lilian Grey was one of the foremost in
this noble work, and four of the soldiers
in company A of the 26th were selected
and sent out by her, with a bounty of
three hundred dollars each, to fight for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
the cause she loved so well. The shadow
on Elinor&#8217;s fair brow deepened day by
day, as news came of terrible battles in
which soldiers on both sides fell by thousands;
and even Mrs. Fenton&#8217;s faith was
sorely tried by the continued absence of
her husband, from whom no word had
ever reached her.</p>

<p>Those were sad, sad days, and every
heart felt the oppression as the hour of
parting drew near. True, &#8220;the battle
of the warrior, with confused noise and
garments rolled in blood,&#8221; came to us
softened by distance, but many that we
loved were there in the thickest of the
fight, and others were going whom we
might see no more on earth. But it was
no time for outward expressions of sorrow,
so we resolutely forced back our
tears, and smiled on our brave boys and
encouraged them with words of comfort
and cheer, when our hearts were dying<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
within us as we thought of the dangers to
which they were to be exposed.</p>

<p>It was expected by all, that on this occasion
Robert Lester would be one of the
first to offer himself to his country, and a
commission as lieutenant-colonel was actually
made out and sent him by the governor,
with the flattering request that he
would not refuse it. But his answer was
the same as before.</p>

<p>&#8220;If I could go at all,&#8221; he said to his
friends, &#8220;it would be as a private soldier;
but it avails not to speak of it; my duty
lies at home.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lilian shunned him more resolutely
than ever, and once said in his hearing,
&#8220;If I were a man, and refused to go when
my country called for my services, I
should expect to be driven from society,
as unworthy the love of woman or the
esteem of my fellow-men.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are too severe, Lilian,&#8221; said the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
gentle Elinor; &#8220;there are many other
ways of serving one&#8217;s country besides
fighting for it, and every one can judge
best for himself what his duty may
be.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a look of intense pain in the
face of the young man as Lilian spoke,
but he drew himself up to his full height,
and the fire in his eye told all who looked
upon him that whatever the cause
might be, it was not lack of courage
which kept him at home.</p>

<p>&#8220;A thousand blessings on you, Miss
Fenton,&#8221; he said in a low voice to Elinor
soon afterwards. &#8220;Your kind heart hesitates
to condemn even where it dares
not approve. You can never know how
much good your words have done me,
suffering as I have from misunderstanding
on every side.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You must pardon dear Lilian,&#8221; she
answered in the same tone; &#8220;she feels<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
very strongly, and your decision has
been a severe disappointment to her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Grey can never need any one
to plead her cause with me,&#8221; he said as
he turned to leave the room.</p>

<p>A few days before the departure of the
regiment Miss Letty came to my house,
her face beaming with smiles, and to my
inquiry what had happened, she answered,</p>

<p>&#8220;So much has happened, I don&#8217;t know
where to begin to tell you. In the first
place, Mr. Fenton has got home with the
rest of his money; but such a time as he
has had to get it. Why, the adventures
of Sinbad the sailor were nothing to the
escapes he has had and the troubles he
has been in. I don&#8217;t think he is much
to speak of, compared with the rest; but
that isn&#8217;t what I am thinking about.
The best of all is, that it has come out
why Robert Lester couldn&#8217;t enlist before,
and now he has joined the company<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
as a private soldier; but, my word for
it, he wont be one long.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you at liberty to state the reason?&#8221;
I inquired.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, certainly. It seems that the
rich old uncle who left him his fortune,
made a condition in his will, that if Robert
died without heirs, the property was
to go to another cousin, one Dick Satterlee,
who is a flaming rebel. Our Mr.
Lester knew that if he was killed, all
that mint of money would go right into
the hands of the Confederate government,
to help on the rebellion. So he
thought he could do more for the Union
cause with the money, than by carrying
a musket and getting shot himself. Besides,
his poor little sister would be left
without any friends, and poor to boot;
so he just made up his mind to stand it
out, and let everybody misjudge him if
they would.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>&#8220;Last week he saw in the list of killed
in some battle, the name of his cousin
Richard Satterlee; so he went right on
to find out all about it. The body hadn&#8217;t
been discovered, but everybody said he
was dead. When Mr. Lester came back,
he waited long enough to make his will,
and then enlisted; and a happy looking
man he was, I can tell you.</p>

<p>&#8220;But that isn&#8217;t all. He was once
engaged to Miss Lilian Grey; but she
was so angry with him because he didn&#8217;t
go into the army, that every thing was
broken off between them, though she
loves him as she does her life, and he
thinks full as much of her. But of course
it will all be made up now, and I&#8217;m glad
of it, for they are just exactly suited to
each other.&#8221;</p>

<p>When I had expressed my surprise
and pleasure at the good news brought
by Miss Letty, I inquired what she intended<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
to do about little Willie, the
son of a deceased sister, to whom she
had been a second mother from his infancy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, there&#8217;s no help for it, I suppose,&#8221;
she answered, while a cloud flitted
over her bright face; &#8220;he is bound to go
as a drummer-boy with the regiment, and
I can&#8217;t persuade him to stay at home
willingly, though he says he wont go
without my consent. It&#8217;s well his poor
mother isn&#8217;t living, for her heart would
break to have him go, such a baby as he
is, only twelve years old. But I must
say for him, he&#8217;s the best boy I ever
saw, and the men all love him so, he&#8217;ll
be well taken care of, if he doesn&#8217;t get
killed. It&#8217;s hard for me; but I&#8217;ve got
nothing else to give, and though it&#8217;s like
taking the heart out of my body, I&#8217;ll try
to do it cheerfully.&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Letty was sewing at the Tyrrell<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
House when she learned from Mr. Ryder
the facts in relation to Robert Lester, and
no time was lost by her in communicating
them to the family. Mrs. Fenton
and Elinor heard with thankfulness that
his fame was publicly cleared, though
they had never doubted that it would be
so in the end.</p>

<p>But to the ardent and enthusiastic
Lilian, by whom he had been so bitterly
condemned, the news was like a reprieve
from death. She threw her arms round
Miss Letty&#8217;s neck, exclaiming,</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you are the best and dearest
Miss Letty in the whole world. I didn&#8217;t
think any thing could have made me so
happy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Lilian, dear, you forget,&#8221; said her
aunt in her gentle tone.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, aunt, I forget nothing,&#8221; Lilian
replied, while her eyes shone through
tears like stars. &#8220;I know we are separated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
by my own rash act, and I shall
honor him only the more if he refuse
again to see me; but I am glad and proud
to know that he is worthy of my love, or
that of any other woman.&#8221;</p>

<p>The days fled rapidly, and still Mr.
Lester did not call on his former friends
the Fentons, and as Lilian went out much
less than usual, they seldom met. He
was unwilling to try to exonerate himself
from a suspicion which he felt to be unreasonable
and degrading, or to sue for
a return of the love he had never forfeited;
and Lilian, though she would gladly
have humbled herself at his feet for having
doubted his honor and loyalty, would
not take the first step, lest her motives
should be misconstrued.</p>

<p>Things were in this state when, on the
evening before the departure of the regiment,
a note from Elinor Fenton was
received by the young soldier, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
brought him quickly to her side. A few
words of explanation passed between
them, and then he was ushered into the
library, where Lilian was busy in preparing
packages of stationery for the
knapsacks that were scattered about.</p>

<p>That interview was one never to be
forgotten by either of the parties. There
were confessions to be made on both
sides, and mutual forgiveness to be exchanged;
for while Lester felt that he
should have intrusted to the woman he
loved the true reasons for his conduct,
Lilian insisted that, knowing him as she
did, she ought never to have doubted his
loyalty under any circumstances. They
parted, pledged to each other, and Lilian
accepted as a sacred legacy the charge
of Fanny Lester, in case of a contingency
which her heart refused to contemplate.</p>

<p>The dreaded morning came at last,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
when our brave boys were to exchange
the comforts and endearments of home,
for the hardships of the camp and the
horrors of the battle-field. But a solemn
ceremony remained to be performed before
they went, and with one accord the
steps of all were turned towards the
parsonage. There, in the pleasant front
yard, under the shadow of the tall elms
that had sheltered her childhood, Mabel
Ryder gave her hand to one whom she
had loved ever since she could remember
any thing. Thomas Wiley, first
lieutenant of company A, was a young
merchant, and had been a pupil of Mr.
Ryder, who saw with pleasure the attachment
existing between the young man
and his darling child, for he knew him
to be one calculated in every way to
make her happy. When he joined the
regiment, Mabel gave a tearful but willing
consent, but with his urgent solicitation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
that she should become his wife before
they went, she would not at first
comply, the time was so short and the
proposition so unexpected; but when he
brought forward the plea, that as his
wife she could with more propriety come
to him if wounded or sick, she yielded.
The privilege of attending him in sickness
or suffering was so precious, that
she could not lightly relinquish it; so it
was fixed that the marriage should take
place on the morning of their departure.</p>

<p>It was a beautiful picture, that wedding
party under the trees, and one not
soon to be forgotten by those who witnessed
it. The fair young bride, dressed
in simple white, with smiles and tears
contending for the mastery on her cheek,
with her bridesmaids, Elinor and Lilian;
the happy groom in his becoming uniform,
supported by Robert Lester and
the second lieutenant of his company;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
the groups of friends scattered about, and
outside of all the boys of the Twenty-sixth
looking on with the deepest interest, as
the pastor and father pronounced with
trembling voice the words that gave his
child to the keeping of another&mdash;all this
is engraven on my memory, and can
never be erased.</p>

<p>The ceremony was over, and as the
regiment wheeled into line, the bridegroom
with one long, silent embrace consigned
Mabel to the care of her friends
and took his place in the ranks. All the
stores were closed and business suspended,
as the Twenty-sixth marched for the
last time, with unbroken columns, through
our streets. The regiment was raised in
the immediate vicinity, and many of its
members were personally known to us;
but at such a moment all seemed like
sons and brothers. We were proud of
their soldierly bearing, of their firm and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
measured tread, of the precision with
which their evolutions were performed,
and the intelligence that lighted up every
face. What eager eyes looked out from
the ranks, to catch the last glimpse of
mother, sister, wife, or sweetheart, as,
amid the waving of handkerchiefs, half-uttered
blessings, and stifled sobs, we
bade them perhaps a final good-by. They
left us full of hope and energy, with all
the courage and strength of young manhood
nerving each arm and animating
each heart. How would they come
back?</p>

<span class="small">THE DRUMMER-BOY OF THE TWENTY-SIXTH.</span></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">After</span> the departure of the regiment
there came to us a season of languor and
depression. We had been in a state of
unnatural excitement for weeks, and the
reaction was inevitable. But for the letters
received regularly from our absent
boys, and which were read and talked
over by all, and the Society meetings,
where we came together to pray and work
for the soldiers, I think we should have
experienced a social stagnation.</p>

<p>Lilian Grey, now more than ever our
&#8220;sunbeam,&#8221; as we loved to call her, was
out of town for a few weeks, and as Elinor
seldom left her mother, who was suffering
more than usual, we saw very little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
of our neighbors in the Tyrrell House.
Mr. Fenton seemed a moody, disappointed
man, soured by a sense of injustice
which he had no power to punish and no
inclination to forgive.</p>

<p>Even Miss Letty, who had always
seemed to possess an unfailing fountain
of cheerfulness and hope, now wore at
times a clouded brow when no tidings
came from Willie, or the news from the
front was unusually warlike. She was
cheered, however, by continued reports
of Willie&#8217;s good conduct and popularity
with the regiment, whose pet he had
been from the first. Of his courage there
could be no question, for he had been in
several severe engagements, and boy as
he was, had stood unflinchingly by the
side of the bravest.</p>

<p>On one occasion, at the close of a hard
fought skirmish, when a furious charge
of the enemy&#8217;s cavalry had driven back<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
his regiment, a division commander riding
over the spot soon after, found Willie
beating a tattoo on his drum as coolly
as if he had been on parade.</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you doing here, my little
fellow?&#8221; said the general.</p>

<p>&#8220;You see, sir,&#8221; he replied, giving the
military salute, &#8220;I didn&#8217;t know but some
of our boys might be about, and I thought
I&#8217;d let them know there was a drummer
here, in case they wanted to form again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But what if the enemy should return,
and find you here alone?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If they should, sir, this is my place,
and I&#8217;d rather they&#8217;d find me here than
skulking, any way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s an unfledged hero for you,&#8221;
was the exclamation of the general as he
rode on; and the next day Willie was
called out and publicly thanked by the
commander in the presence of all the
troops. &#8220;It was an instance of bravery<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
which would have done honor to a veteran.&#8221;
Such were the words of the general,
and a happy woman was his aunt
as she read them in a letter written by
Robert Lester on the occasion.</p>

<p>Then came to us the news of the invasion
of Maryland by the rebels, and in a
few days the battle of Antietam flashed
over the wires, and with others we exulted
in the victory, little thinking how
deeply it was to affect us, for we supposed
the Twenty-sixth to be in a division
at some distance from the seat of war.</p>

<p>But a few days served to undeceive
us; and then, as the &#8220;terrible list&#8221; of
killed and wounded was read with dimming
eyes and blanched cheeks, we
learned how fearful was the loss our own
troops had sustained. Robert Lester,
who had risen rapidly from the ranks,
and had been made captain on the field
at Williamsburg, was wounded, it was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
thought, mortally. Our dear little Willie
had lost an arm, and Lieut. Wiley,
the bridegroom of an hour, had fallen
gloriously at the head of his company,
while cheering them on. Many others
whom we knew and loved had also died
on the field, rendered immortal by their
bravery.</p>

<p>In the evening of the day on which
the news reached us, I went to the parsonage,
and found our good clergyman
preparing to start for Maryland to look
after our wounded, and to bring home
the body of Lieut. Wiley. Poor Mabel
had been overwhelmed by the sad intelligence,
and as her mother was wholly
occupied with the heart-broken girl, there
was no one to assist Mr. Ryder; but
Miss Letty came in soon after me, and
she was a host in herself. She was very
pale, but cheerful and efficient as ever,
thinking of everybody and every thing,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
and bringing order out of confusion by
the magic of her touch. When I expressed
the hope that she would remain
at the parsonage with Mrs. Ryder and
Mabel, she answered,</p>

<p>&#8220;Bless you, dear, you don&#8217;t suppose I
could stay here, and little Willie lying
with an arm cut off at Hagerstown; do
you? There is nobody can do for him as
I can, who am like a mother to him; and
if they could, I shouldn&#8217;t be willing to
have them. No, no, I am going to start
to-night with Mr. Ryder, and I shall
count the minutes till we get there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But have you no preparations to
make for yourself for such a journey?&#8221;
I inquired.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, my preparations were all made
hours ago, as soon as I heard the news.
I have put up every thing I shall be
likely to want for my boy; and as for
myself, I am always ready, you know.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
There is nothing to be done but to fix up
Mr. Ryder and be off. Miss Lilian and
poor Fanny Lester are going with us, to
see the captain, if he&#8217;s alive; and who
knows but their going may save his life,
if he isn&#8217;t dead when they get there.
Some folks will blame Miss Lilian for
going; but Fanny can&#8217;t go without her,
and she wont care much for talk when
she thinks she&#8217;s doing right.&#8221;</p>

<p>I saw the little company off a few
hours later, and a sorrowful parting it
was, though Miss Letty and Lilian tried
hard to assume a courage they did not
feel, to comfort Fanny Lester, whose
grief was terrible to witness; and how I
loved and admired Lilian, when I saw
her so forgetful of self, soothing and sustaining
the weeping sister, while her own
heart was bleeding silently. This young
girl was not one to proclaim her sorrow
on the house-tops, or to make noisy demands<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
for sympathy. When the iron
entered her soul, she would turn away
quietly from observation, and pursuing
her daily round of duty, pour the tale of
her suffering into the ear of Infinite pity
alone.</p>

<p>It may be that I am about to betray
Miss Letty&#8217;s confidence; but her letters
from Hagerstown were such faithful
transcripts of her heart and character,
that I cannot resist the temptation to
give a few extracts from them to my
readers.</p>

<p>&#8220;... I wish I could give you some
idea of the hospitals here, but I can&#8217;t begin
to describe them. The rooms look
airy and clean enough; but, Oh dear,
those long rows of beds, with poor suffering,
maimed, dying heroes lying on
them, some with faces paler than the
sheets, some burning up with fever, and
all having such a tired, anxious look, as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
if they wanted somebody to comfort
them; and, poor fellows, they do need it
bad enough, I can tell you. I should
have been glad to stop and say a kind
word to every one of them, but a nurse
hurried me on to a little room beyond
the large one, with three or four beds in
it, and there, on a cot, I found my boy,
looking as white and weak as could be,
but just as pleasant as ever.</p>

<p>&#8220;He was asleep, and I didn&#8217;t want to
wake him, so I took a chair very softly,
and sat down close by the dear little
fellow till his nap was out. The first I
knew, the tears were dripping, dripping
into my lap just like rain. I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;d
no thought of crying in that place, but
there were tears in my heart when I saw
that dear little face all drawn up with
pain in his sleep, and when I thought
about that arm that had been round my
neck so often, and never would be any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
more. By and by he waked up, and
when he saw me sitting there, he gave
one shout, and if the sun had been shining
right into his eyes, they couldn&#8217;t
have been any brighter. That one look
would have paid me for all the journey,
if I hadn&#8217;t done a single thing for
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Oh, aunty,&#8217; says he, &#8216;I was just
dreaming that you had come, and it
seemed so good to have you over me
once more, and now here you are. I
don&#8217;t know what to say, our Father is
so good to me.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was as much as I could do to
speak, but I made out to tell him I had
come to stay and take care of him till he
could go home with me.</p>

<p>&#8220;He gave his head a little shake, just
as he used to when he wasn&#8217;t certain
about a thing, and said,</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;I don&#8217;t think much about going to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
that home, Aunt Letty; I&#8217;m a little boy,
you know, to have an arm cut off, and
mine isn&#8217;t doing very well, I know from
the doctor&#8217;s looks. But it will all come
out right;&#8217; and such a smile as there was
on his face. &#8216;And now, dear aunty,
give me another kiss, and I&#8217;ll turn over
and go to sleep again; and I wish you
could too, you look so tired.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;I told him I wasn&#8217;t tired, and then
I shook up his pillow, and he turned
over and went right to sleep like the
lamb he is.</p>

<p>&#8220;All this while there had been a pair
of great black eyes watching me ever so
wishfully the other side of the room; so
when Willie was asleep, I thought I&#8217;d
find out who they belonged to. I went
over to the bed, and found a poor young
fellow eighteen years old, who looked as
if he couldn&#8217;t live twenty-four hours.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Is there any thing I can do for you?&#8217;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
said I, for I felt awfully to see him lie
there looking so pitiful.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;O yes, ma&#8217;am,&#8217; said he; &#8216;if you
will only speak a few kind words to me,
and smooth my hair as you did little
Willie&#8217;s, it would do me so much good.
I thought when I saw you kiss his forehead,
if my mother could only come and
do that, it would be easier to die.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Well, my dear boy,&#8217; said I, &#8216;I a&#8217;n&#8217;t
your mother, nor any of your relation;
but I&#8217;m a fellow-creature, and I feel for
you, and am willing to do any thing I
can to make you comfortable.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;So I got some bay-rum from a nurse,
and bathed his hot hands and face, and
brushed his hair and smoothed his pillow,
and then I gave him just such a kiss
as I did Willie, and I a&#8217;n&#8217;t ashamed to
own it. The big tears were in his eyes,
and he said,</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;I didn&#8217;t think any thing in the world<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
could do me so much good. It seems as
if mother was here, and I thank you a
thousand times.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I asked him if there was any
thing more he wanted, and what do you
think he said?</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;If you could only read a few verses
out of my Bible and pray with me, I
should be so glad. I&#8217;m going to die,
and I a&#8217;n&#8217;t afraid to go, but I do want
somebody to read and pray with me
first.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Only think of that; for me, who never
dared to speak loud in any meeting at
home, to be asked to pray with a sick
man in a hospital! It was like a blow
to me, and for a minute I didn&#8217;t know
what to say; but there were those eyes
looking right through me, and he said
softly, &#8216;If you only could.&#8217; So I plucked
up courage, and said, &#8216;I <i>will</i>,&#8217; and
then I shut to the door and read a chapter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
in a low voice, just so he could hear
me, and tried to ask God to help and
comfort the poor boy, for he was nothing
more. When I got through, he took hold
of my hand, and said, &#8216;I can&#8217;t thank you
for your kindness as I want to, but God
will reward you, I&#8217;m sure. Take the
blessing of a dying man, and remember
you have comforted my last hours.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was ashamed to hear him speak so;
for after all, what had I done to deserve
thanks for?</p>

<p>&#8220;He died the next day, and I staid by
him all I could when Willie didn&#8217;t need
me, and wrote a letter to his mother just
as he gave the words to me only an hour
or two before he breathed his last. Poor
woman! I pitied her, for he was a noble-looking
fellow, and one that feared
God, and I know a mother must have set
a great store by such a son.&#8221;</p>

<p>In another letter she wrote,</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>&#8220;My little Willie is getting along very
slowly, and the doctors look sober about
him, and I know they&#8217;re afraid he&#8217;s going
into a decline. His mother died of
that, and they say the shock to his system
has been so great that it may not be
able to rally again. But he&#8217;s just as
happy as the day is long, and says if he
had twenty arms, he&#8217;d be willing to give
them all for his country.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see much of the captain or
Miss Lilian, for he is in another building
where the officers are; and he&#8217;s so low,
they don&#8217;t let anybody visit him unless
they have a special permit from the doctor.
I believe they have a little more
hope of him than they had at first, but
Miss Lilian says his life hangs by a single
thread. Dear Miss Lilian, she looks
tired and pale, but her smile is just as
bright as ever, and when she comes to
see Willie, it always cheers him up, like
a breath of fresh air or a bunch of flowers.&#8221;</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_068.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>While Miss Letty was away in Hagerstown,
a letter came to the Fenton&#8217;s
from their absent son, who was a prisoner
in our lines, and had been severely
wounded, bringing the joyful intelligence
that he had taken from his heart the oath
of allegiance to the dear old flag. As
soon as he could travel he would come
home for a short visit, and then join the
Union army. He told them how he had
been left for dead on the field at Williamsburg,
and that a little drummer-boy
chanced to find him; that he brought
him water at the risk of his own life,
and finally had him carried from the
field by some members of the Twenty-sixth,
to which regiment the boy belonged.</p>

<p>While in the hospital there, he said
little Willie visited him often at his own<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
special request, and to the artless conversation
of this child he attributed his
first convictions of the wrong course he
had been pursuing. &#8220;It was the last
thing he thought of,&#8221; the letter concluded,
&#8220;to teach me, whom he regarded as
greatly his superior; but his thoughts, so
far beyond his years, brought to mind
the neglected lessons of my precious
mother, and now, if I am like the repenting
prodigal, I owe it, under God, to that
dear boy, whose heroism is only equalled
by the kindness of his heart.&#8221;</p>

<p>It will be readily believed that the
Fentons were enthusiastic in their expressions
of love and gratitude to Willie
for the signal service he had rendered
them, and a letter was sent at once to
Miss Letty informing her of the facts,
and entreating her to bring the dear invalid
to the Tyrrell House immediately
on her return.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>It was a lovely evening in early autumn
when Miss Letty and her charge
came back to us, and the first glance at
Willie&#8217;s pale, sweet face told us that his
days were numbered. Yet his spirits
were so buoyant, his enjoyment of every
thing so earnest and childlike, it was
hard to believe that he was indeed passing
away from earth.</p>

<p>When I first visited him at the Tyrrell
House, he was sitting up in an easy-chair
in a room overlooking the garden, and
with choice flowers all about him. He
smiled as I took his hand and inquired
after his health, saying,</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m quite well, and so happy. I
can&#8217;t think what makes everybody so
kind to me. I don&#8217;t deserve it at all,
but God puts it into their hearts, and I
thank him for it. If dear Miss Lilian was
only here; but I&#8217;m so glad she&#8217;s with
the captain.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>&#8220;Were you in Captain Lester&#8217;s company?&#8221;
I asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;O yes, he got me transferred; and,
Mrs. Glenn, I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s another
man in the world like Captain Lester.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In what respect, Willie?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In every thing. The men all love
him so, they&#8217;d give their lives for him;
and yet he&#8217;s very strict, and wont have
any drinking or gambling or swearing in
the camp. They have to do just right,
and then he&#8217;s the kindest man I ever
saw. If anybody is sick or in trouble,
they know where to go for help; and
when the chaplain is away, he prays and
reads a sermon to the men in the big
tent every Sunday. Oh dear, I do
hope he wont die.&#8221; And the tears,
which no sufferings of his own could call
forth, fell fast for those of his beloved
captain.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>&#8220;Willie,&#8221; I said, &#8220;do you remember
any thing about being wounded, and how
you felt then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not much at first. It is all like a
confused dream; how we marched all
day to get up with the army; how we
lay down to escape the shot and shell
that the rebs were pouring into us; and
at last, how the captain called out to us,
&#8216;Now, boys, is your time!&#8217; and then we
went in on the double-quick, till we were
in the thickest of it. It seems somehow
as if that was years ago; but all at once,
when I was beating my drum as hard as
I could, I felt as if I was falling down
ever so far, and I didn&#8217;t know any thing
more for a good while.</p>

<p>&#8220;When I came to myself, the fighting
was over, and the rebs all gone; but I
was so weak that I couldn&#8217;t stir nor
speak, and I thought my time had come;
but I didn&#8217;t feel afraid to die.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>&#8220;You remember, ma&#8217;am, the time of
that revival in the Sabbath-school, when
several of the children were admitted to
the church? I think I gave my heart to
the Saviour then; and though Aunt Letty
thought I was too young to come forward
with them, I have always loved my Bible
better than any other book; and when I
lay there, I tried to look up to the Lord
Jesus, but my eyes were heavy, and
wouldn&#8217;t keep open. Then it seemed as
if angels were all round me, and I forgot
my pain and how much I wanted water,
and went to sleep again. The next thing
I knew, I was in the hospital, and my
arm gone.&#8221;</p>

<p>I was affected to tears by this simple
recital, and could hardly command my
voice to say,</p>

<p>&#8220;But, Willie, you have always been
very full of life and activity; does it never
seem hard to you to lose your arm, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
to be shut up here so sick, and perhaps
to die?&#8221;</p>

<p>His face flushed, and he looked up
in surprise, but soon answered pleasantly,</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you are only asking that to try
me; you couldn&#8217;t mean it in earnest, I&#8217;m
sure. Why, there never was any boy
who had so many blessings as I have.
In the first place, it was such goodness
in God to let me go out with the regiment,
such a poor little fellow as I am.
Then when I was hurt, he sent dear Aunt
Letty to take care of me, and bring me
home here to such a nice place, and
such kind friends. It isn&#8217;t any matter
about my arm, for when I die I&#8217;ll have
wings, you know, and so it will never be
missed.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dear young disciple! So early and
plainly taught of the blessed Saviour,
what could older Christians do but sit at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
thy feet and learn wisdom from thy simple,
childlike words?</p>

<p>While I still lingered, unable to tear
myself away from a scene so peaceful
and hallowed, Mrs. Flint came in, and
took a seat by his side. Her looks and
voice were carefully graduated to suit
the occasion as she said,</p>

<p>&#8220;I am glad to see you so comfortable,
and hope, my dear child, that the chastisement
of the Lord is doing you good.
Do you feel that this is the case?&#8221;</p>

<p>Willie was a brave, happy boy naturally,
and religion had added to these
traits a firm trust in God as his Father,
through Jesus Christ, so he smiled as he
answered,</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know, ma&#8217;am; I hope I love
the Saviour, and I know he loves me, and
he gives me so many blessings I don&#8217;t
think much about punishment. I don&#8217;t
feel as if he was angry with me, when he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
has died for me, and I want to please him
more than any thing else in the world.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am afraid, my dear,&#8221; she replied,
&#8220;that you do not realize how great a sinner
you are, if you think you don&#8217;t deserve
punishment for your sins.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No indeed, it isn&#8217;t that,&#8221; Willie exclaimed,
while his cheeks flushed with
the excitement of his feelings. But Miss
Letty could keep silence no longer, and
interrupted him, saying,</p>

<p>&#8220;Mrs. Flint, my little Willie can&#8217;t talk
much now, but I think he lives religion
better than a great many of us. He
means, and I say, that though we don&#8217;t
deserve any thing but punishment for
our sins, it isn&#8217;t always a sign that God
is angry with us when he lets us suffer in
this world. He wasn&#8217;t angry with Job,
when he allowed Satan to try him so;
nor with Daniel, when he was put into
the lions&#8217; den; but he did it to show what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
religion could do for people when they
are in the worst of troubles. I believe
it&#8217;s just so nowadays; and that God is
nearer to us sometimes when every thing
seems to go wrong, than he is when it&#8217;s
fair weather and smooth sailing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That may be so,&#8221; replied Mrs. Flint,
&#8220;but don&#8217;t you think there&#8217;s danger of
making the way of religion too easy, so
that people will think they are Christians
when they are not?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think we have any thing to
do with making the way hard or easy.
We must take it just as Jesus Christ left
it; and he says, &#8216;I love them that love
me, and those that seek me early shall
find me.&#8217; I don&#8217;t read that any thing
but repentance and faith in the Saviour,
and renewing by the Holy Spirit, is necessary
to be a humble Christian; and I
am sure the Saviour never turned away
any one who came to him in earnest, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
wanted to be his disciple. But Willie is
getting tired, and it wont do to talk any
longer.&#8221;</p>

<p>The visitor departed, leaving the little
invalid weary and feverish, until soothed
by the gentle ministrations of Miss Letty
and Elinor Fenton. Why is it that some
individuals, who pass in society for good
people, have the unenviable talent of
making every one uncomfortable with
whom they come in contact? Under all
the velvet of their professions, the claws
continually lacerate, even while they
seem to caress. There are few communities
in which some of these specimens
of humanity may not be found; and it is
sad when they wear the garb of religion,
and pretend to be holier than others,
while doing the work of him who has
sought from the beginning to foment strife
and jealousy among brethren.</p>

<p>During the fall, Willie had several attacks<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
of hemorrhage of the lungs, which
rapidly wasted his strength; but he was
still the same happy, trusting, loving boy,
enjoying life with all a boy&#8217;s enthusiasm,
yet welcoming death with perfect serenity.</p>

<p>On one of the last days of the Indian
summer, when a golden haze lay on every
thing, softening the landscape and
giving to autumn more than the beauty
of spring, I was called to see Willie die.
I found him sitting up in bed, gasping
for breath, and his forehead damp with
the death-dew; but his eye was still
clear, and on his lips was a smile bright
with heaven&#8217;s own radiance. &#8220;Dear
Willie,&#8221; I said, &#8220;you are almost home.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;O yes, I like this home very much,
but that one is better. I am where
Christian was when he began to cross
the river, and in a little while I shall be
over.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>Bunyan&#8217;s inimitable allegory was his
favorite book, and he had it almost by
heart. While in camp it had been his
greatest pleasure to repeat portions of it
to the listening soldiers, by whom &#8220;Willie&#8217;s
stories&#8221; were preferred to any other.
And now on his dying-bed the pilgrim
was to him a living friend who had crossed
the stream just before him, and whom
he was about to join in the Celestial City.</p>

<p>&#8220;Willie,&#8221; said Mr. Ryder, &#8220;have you
no wish to live?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To live!&#8221; he repeated with animation;
&#8220;why, don&#8217;t you know I am just
going to live? Oh, if you could only see
what I see, such beautiful angels with
shining wings, and hear the sweet music,
you would be willing to die too, so that
you could go and live with them.&#8221;</p>

<p>The eloquence of look and tone with
which this was said is indescribable. He
lay quietly for a few moments with closed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
eyes, then suddenly turning to Miss Letty,
who was weeping, he said,</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear aunty, you told me of Jesus,
and taught me how to seek him, and now
I am going to live with him for ever.
Perhaps he will let me fly down to you
sometimes, and whisper to you about
heaven when you are sorrowful; I should
love to so much. If I could only have
seen the captain and Miss Lilian once
more; but no matter, they&#8217;ll come,
you&#8217;ll all come home by and by.&#8221;</p>

<p>His voice failed, and he seemed almost
gone, when raising his hand, he
whispered,</p>

<p>&#8220;They are all coming, mother; it is
light, all light;&#8221; and then with one long
tremulous sigh, the ransomed spirit fled,
leaving the impress of its happiness.</p>

<p>We buried him in a quiet spot, selected
by himself near his childhood&#8217;s home,
and a plain marble slab, with the inscription,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
&#8220;<span class="smcap">Our Willie</span>,&#8221; marks his resting-place.
His drum, a beautiful and richly
ornamented one given him by his regiment
after the battle of Malvern Hills,
and which he kept constantly near him
through all his illness, was enclosed in a
glass case, and placed at the head of his
grave. We shall see him no more on
earth, but the memory of the little drummer-boy
is still cherished in the hearts
of many who loved him here, and who
hope to meet him in the better land
where &#8220;sorrow and parting are sounds
unknown.&#8221;</p>

<span class="small">HOW THE BOYS CAME HOME.</span></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Capt. Lester</span> was carried from the
field of Antietam insensible, and on examination
his wounds were pronounced
mortal by the physicians, though no
means were left untried to preserve a
life so valuable to his country. A mini&eacute;
ball had passed through his shoulder to the
back of the neck, and at the same time
the fragment of a shell struck his ankle,
inflicting a severe wound, and splintering
the bone. He lay for several days in
a half-unconscious state&mdash;at times, when
partially roused, becoming delirious, then
sinking again into a lethargy from which
it was difficult to awaken him. A private
house had been hastily fitted up for
the reception of the wounded, and to this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
he was taken and made as comfortable
as circumstances admitted.</p>

<p>When Fanny Lester and Lilian reached
the end of their journey, they were at
first denied admittance to the hospital;
and it was only after the most strenuous
exertions on the part of Mr. Ryder that
they were allowed to see Capt. Lester.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am afraid, my dear young friends,&#8221;
said the good man, &#8220;that you will not be
permitted to remain with him; the military
rules are very strict, and few favors
are shown here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have no fears on that score, my dear
sir,&#8221; Lilian replied. &#8220;If once we gain
entrance, it will take at least a regiment
to dislodge us.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was evening when they entered the
room where the sick man lay, seemingly
insensible to every thing around him;
and as Lilian approached, the nurse who
had been moistening his lips from time<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
to time, came forward, and greeting her
kindly, offered her a seat by his side.
Though terribly shocked at his death-like
appearance, Lilian was outwardly
calm; and taking from the nurse minute
directions with regard to the treatment
to be pursued, busied herself in arranging
the dressings and medicines, to conceal
the emotion which threatened to
overpower her.</p>

<p>When this was done, she seated herself
by the bedside, and taking the hand
of the wounded man, placed her fingers
on his wrist to assure herself that he still
lived, for in that darkened room his sleep
so closely resembled death, that her heart
stood still with terror as she looked upon
him. Hardly had she touched his wrist
when a perceptible thrill ran through the
veins; there was a slight movement, and
then a faint voice whispered, &#8220;Is this
Lilian?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>Too much agitated to reply at once,
she gave him the stimulant prescribed by
the nurse, turned up the lamp that she
might see his face, and then said as calmly
as she could,</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Robert, it is your sister and
Lilian, who have come to nurse and make
you well.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank God!&#8221; was the low response;
and then he seemed to sleep again, while
Lilian watched him through the night,
glad to find that her young companion
had forgotten her sorrows in refreshing
slumber. From that time Capt. Lester&#8217;s
symptoms were slightly improved, and
he had more frequent intervals of consciousness,
though there were yet but
faint hopes of his recovery. If medical
skill and the most assiduous care could
save him, he was certain to recover, for
Lilian or Fanny were with him night
and day, anticipating every want, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
soothing by their tender sympathy the
sufferings which no skill could wholly
relieve.</p>

<p>For some weeks it was feared by the
surgeons that amputation of the foot must
take place; and nothing but the prayers
and tears of Lilian induced them to delay
it, until, by the blessing of God on
her exertions, it was no longer deemed
necessary. The ball still remained in
his shoulder, and had hitherto eluded
search; but it was at length found and
extracted; and from that hour his progress,
though slow, was sure.</p>

<p>&#8220;How is it, Robert,&#8221; said Lilian one
day, when he was suffering more than
usual from his wounds, &#8220;that you are
always so cheerful and patient, though
you suffer so much? I have heard that
convalescents are expected to be irritable
and capricious, but you do not avail
yourself of the privilege at all. You<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
must be naturally indifferent to pain, or
else you have too much pride to allow it
to overcome you; which is it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Neither the one nor the other, dear
Lilian. I have naturally a great dread
of pain, and do not think myself possessed
of a large share of that moral courage
in which your sex excel, and which is
the only kind which will bear the test of
suffering. As to pride, it is sadly out of
place on a sick-bed, even if it had the
power to deaden a sense of pain, which
I very much doubt.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it then that makes you so desirable
a patient? for, excepting my aunt,
I never saw any one bear pain as you do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Shall I tell you, my Lilian? It is
the taking home to my heart, and appropriating
that precious promise, &#8216;My grace
is sufficient for thee, for my strength is
made perfect in weakness.&#8217; In myself I
am all weakness; but if an almighty arm<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
is underneath and around me, I have all
the strength and support I need. God
grant that you may know from your own
experience the blessedness of which I
speak.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tears were in the eyes of Lilian as
she answered,</p>

<p>&#8220;With such examples as I have had
before me, I can never doubt the reality
of the religion of Jesus, and I would give
worlds, if I had them, to feel its power;
but it seems impossible for me to obtain
such a blessing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, and
thou shalt be saved,&#8221; was the reply.
&#8220;And now, dear Lilian, I must send you
from me to visit our poor patient up
stairs, who needs you even more than I
do, if that were possible.&#8221;</p>

<p>A few days previous to this conversation,
Lilian was passing through one of
the rooms in which lay some rebel officers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
who had been recently brought in
from Virginia. Most of them were hopeless
cases, and the sight was so painful to
the young girl, that she passed on rapidly,
until her steps were arrested by the
exclamation, &#8220;Miss Grey! can it be
possible?&#8221; She turned and saw, though
she could hardly recognize in the pallid
face and emaciated form before her,
Lieut. Carter, the betrothed of her cousin,
the rebel officer whose desertion of
his country&#8217;s flag had caused them all so
much unhappiness. It was a very painful
meeting to Lilian, and her first impulse
was to leave the room instantly;
but death was stamped on every feature
of the young man, and humanity triumphed.
She approached the bedside,
and said kindly,</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Carter, I can stay but a moment.
Is there any thing I can do for you, or
that you wish to say to me?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>The sick man replied bitterly,</p>

<p>&#8220;I see how it is; you all hate and
despise me; but I cannot help it. I am
a Southerner, and would not desert my
brethren in arms though I lost every
friend on earth. What I have done I
would do again in the same circumstances.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are wrong, Hugh,&#8221; said Lilian,
&#8220;none of us hate or despise you, though
the course you have taken has almost
broken the hearts of those who loved you
so dearly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And who love me no longer, you
would say. Well, I knew the penalty
when I put on this uniform, and I am
not going now to complain of the cost. I
hate the Yankees,&#8221; he exclaimed with
an energy of which he seemed incapable,
&#8220;and the bitterest thought in dying is,
that Elinor has become one of their miserable
canting crew; but they have lost<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
Stanwood; he at least is true to the bonny
blue flag.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not so, Hugh. Stanwood has seen
his error, and taken the oath of allegiance
at Washington, and only waits
until his wounds are healed to go home
and be reconciled to his family.&#8221;</p>

<p>The sick man turned ghastly pale on
hearing this, and an execration rose to
his lips, which was suppressed from deference
to Lilian, who added,</p>

<p>&#8220;You are very ill, Hugh, and thoughts
like these are not suited to one in your
condition. Let me beg you to see the
chaplain; he is a good man, and will
gladly visit you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh spare me all that stereotyped
nonsense,&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;I will die as
I have lived, without the aid of priest or
chaplain. If my belief is correct, I do
not need them; and if I am wrong, it is
too late to mend the mistake. I am dying,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
and you know it; but I will at least
die game: no whining repentance or
hypocritical confessions for Hugh Carter.&#8221;</p>

<p>There seemed little hope of doing him
any good in such a state of mind, and
Lilian, feeling her own incompetency to
reply to him, sadly turned away and left
the room, while memory went back to
other days, when he who was going into
eternity without one ray of light upon
his path, had been to her almost a brother.
There was a shadow on her bright
face as she went back to her patient, who
instantly saw it, and inquired the cause,
when she related the scene through which
she had just passed. Capt. Lester had
formerly known Lieut. Carter, and though
no bond of affinity had ever drawn the
young men together, he was greatly
shocked to learn his present condition.</p>

<p>&#8220;I must see him, dear Lilian,&#8221; he said;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
&#8220;he may listen to me when he would not
admit a clergyman. It is too dreadful to
let him die so, without making one effort
to do him good. Poor Elinor, how could
she bear this?&#8221;</p>

<p>With great difficulty, and on crutches,
Capt. Lester made his way to the bedside
of the wounded officer; but the latter
refused to converse with him, declaring
that his mind was made up, and he
would never be such a coward as to
change his opinions because death was
at hand. In vain he was urged to listen
to God&#8217;s own words of promise.</p>

<p>&#8220;To those who can believe, all that is
well enough; as for me, I have never
feared any thing in life, and cannot begin
to tremble now.&#8221;</p>

<p>A few days afterwards he died in the
same state of mind, declaring with his
latest breath that he asked no favors at
the hands of God or man.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>Elinor was informed of his death, but
not of the circumstances attending it;
and thus she was spared the keenest
pang of all&mdash;that of knowing that he
whom she had once loved and trusted,
died without hope.</p>

<p>One after another our brave boys came
back to us from the hospitals, wounded
and disabled, some maimed for life, yet
bating no tittle of courage or faith in the
ultimate triumph of the good cause. A
part of the regiment had re&euml;nlisted at
the expiration of their term of service,
and were with us for a few days, enjoying
the sweets of domestic life after their
laborious campaigns.</p>

<p>It was during their stay that the death
of little Willie occurred, and the drummer-boy
was followed to his grave by
many of those who knew and loved him
as a son or brother in the camp. There
were manly tears shed around his grave;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
and one man exclaimed, as the coffin was
lowered from sight,</p>

<p>&#8220;There goes the best boy I ever knew,
and I don&#8217;t believe he has left his like
behind him.&#8221;</p>

<p>The first snows of winter had fallen on
Willie&#8217;s grave before Capt. Lester came
back to us, with his sister and a lady
whom we had loved as Lilian Grey, but
were now to know as Mrs. Lester. She
was well aware that the prejudices of
her uncle and cousin would be shocked
by her marriage away from home and in
a hospital; so she said nothing about it
in her letters, believing that her husband
could plead his own cause far better in
person than she could do by writing.
The event justified her expectations; for
though at first Mr. Fenton was surprised
and angry, the reasons given by Capt.
Lester and the persuasions of his wife
soon reconciled him, and even forced him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
to confess that it was probably the best
thing that could have been done under
the circumstances. Mrs. Fenton, however,
would not consent to part with her
niece; so Capt. Lester became an inmate
of the family, and soon won the affection
of all its members, while his health improved
rapidly, though the wound in his
ankle was still painful and troublesome.</p>

<p>Soon after Capt. Lester&#8217;s return, there
came a visitor to the parsonage whose
arrival was warmly welcomed by Mabel,
though it caused her tears to flow afresh.
This was the father of Lieut. Wiley, who
had taken the journey for the purpose
of becoming acquainted with the bride of
his son, now doubly endeared to him by
her early widowhood and sorrow.</p>

<p>He was a plain New England farmer,
cultivating a few acres of hard soil, from
which he managed by unceasing industry
to gain a support for his small family;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
but he was rich in faith, and his benevolence
would shame that of many a
millionaire. His son had left home while
still very young; but he was fondly remembered,
and his loss lamented by the
aged pair, who had only one daughter
left to be the stay of their declining years.</p>

<p>Mr. Wiley went from house to house
through the Beach Hill neighborhood,
wherever a disabled soldier or a bereaved
wife or mother were to be found,
often accompanied by Mabel, who in her
mourning garb looked so pale and shadowy
that we almost expected to see her
vanish from our sight. The old man
loved to hear and talk of his dead son;
but he loved still more to speak of Him
who died for sinners, and of the heaven
to which his disciples are hastening. It
was impossible on such occasions for the
most careless to listen unmoved; and
tears were often seen to steal down the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
cheeks of bearded men, though all &#8220;unused
to the melting mood,&#8221; as they heard
from his lips the story so often told, yet
ever new, of Gethsemane and Calvary.</p>

<p>The visit of Mr. Wiley was a blessing
to many souls in Woodbury, and especially
to Mabel and Lilian, both of whom
made a public profession of faith in Christ
the Sabbath before his departure. When
he left for home, Mabel and her mother
went with him, as our physician recommended
a change of scene for the former,
whose health was suffering from the
shock she had sustained.</p>

<p>Capt. Lester had now so far recovered
as to walk with only the assistance of a
cane, when, one evening after Lilian had
been spending the day with me, he came
in bringing a large package, which he
threw into her lap, saying, &#8220;Read that,
dear wife, and then tell me what to do.&#8221;</p>

<p>She opened the envelope and found<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
inclosed a commission as colonel of a
veteran regiment then being raised, with
a letter in which flattering mention was
made of Capt. Lester&#8217;s services in the
army, and the estimation in which he
was held by the chief magistrate of the
state.</p>

<p>Lilian&#8217;s eyes sparkled with all a wife&#8217;s
pride as she read the letter, and turning
to her husband, she said, &#8220;There ought
to be but one cause for hesitation on such
a subject. If you are well enough to go,
you cannot doubt for a moment your
duty to accept it. I would not hold you
back, if I could, and I am certain that I
could not, if I would.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thanks, dear Lilian; I knew your
brave and true heart would cheer me on
in the path of duty; but I have been a
petted invalid so long, that I am ashamed
to say the thought of leaving all I love
was at first painful to me.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>&#8220;And may I not go with you?&#8221; she
inquired; &#8220;you know how well I can
bear hardships; and I assure you I will
take care that you shall find me no incumbrance.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That you could never be, in any
case,&#8221; was his reply; &#8220;but the coming
campaign is likely to be a fatiguing and
perilous one, and besides, I must not set
an example of self-indulgence to the regiment.
It would never do for the colonel
to be enjoying the society of his wife,
unless he grants the same privilege to
the other officers, and in that case, I fear
we should be in danger of losing the
name of the &#8216;fighting regiment,&#8217; which
the veterans have so nobly earned.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I submit, as in duty bound, to your
decision; but I must have a promise that
I may come to you instantly, if at any
time you should need me.&#8221;</p>

<p>The promise was readily given, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
Lilian smiled through her tears as she
playfully pictured his helplessness, when
he should find himself thrown once more
on his own resources.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know you have almost spoiled me,&#8221;
he replied in the same tone, &#8220;but the
camp is a good school in which to learn
to endure hardships and self-denial, and
I am not likely to want for lessons in our
present service.&#8221;</p>

<p>Several members of the Twenty-sixth,
when they found that Capt. Lester was
to have the command of a regiment,
were transferred, and most of his field
and line officers were old friends and
comrades, so we bade him farewell cheerfully,
though his health was not fully re&euml;stablished.</p>

<p>True to her former professions, Lilian
sent him forth with smiles and blessings;
and after his departure, she had always
a word of comfort and cheer for those<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
who had given their household treasures
to the cause of freedom. But the few
who knew her intimately, knew that she
shed bitter tears when no eye but that
of God was upon her, as she thought of
the perils by which he was surrounded,
and which he had neither the power nor
the wish to shun.</p>

<p>The regiment commanded by Col. Lester
was in the second division of the
Sixth corps in the Army of the Potomac,
and was stationed near the enemy&#8217;s outposts,
so that picket-firing and skirmishing
were of daily occurrence, though there
had been no general engagement since
the battle of Gettysburg.</p>

<p>That grand Army of the Potomac;
how my heart thrills as I think or write
of it! Composed, as no other army on
earth ever was made up, save our own
noble troops of the West and South-west,
of the very flower of American manhood,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
with youth, wealth, intellect, and talent
filling its ranks, and yet, by a strange
fatality, doomed to experience unmerited
defeats or fruitless victories, it has waited
with a courage and patience truly sublime
for the moment of triumph which is
sure to come at last. So often decimated,
yet never subdued, but Ant&aelig;us-like,
gathering fresh vigor from every disaster,
they have not always been able to command
success, but they have done more;
for they have deserved it. In the coming
time, when this fearful war shall have
passed into history, and our children are
reaping its glorious results, it will be a
prouder boast than that of royal lineage
to have the right to say, &#8220;My father was
a soldier in the Army of the Potomac.&#8221;</p>

<span class="small">LIGHTS AND SHADOWS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">I had</span> been absent from home for several
weeks, and after my return, sickness
in the family confined me closely,
so that I knew little of what had been
occurring in the neighborhood. Miss
Letty, through whom my information usually
came, was seldom seen abroad, to
the great surprise and inconvenience of
many families who had learned to look
upon her frequent visits as an indispensable
part of their domestic arrangements.</p>

<p>&#8220;What has happened to Miss Letty?&#8221;
I inquired of Lilian Lester, at a meeting
of our Aid Society, as I noticed the look
of gravity which seemed strangely out
of place on her countenance, usually so
cheerful.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>&#8220;I am not aware of any cause for it,&#8221;
Lilian replied, &#8220;and yet she certainly
does look as if she were carrying a weight
of care. Dear Miss Letty, I hope nothing
has happened to trouble her, for she
is so kind and unselfish that she ought to
be very happy.&#8221;</p>

<p>As I left the house, Miss Letty came
up, and proposed to accompany me home,
an offer which I gladly accepted, for it
was evident that there was something
she wished to communicate, and I hoped,
by sharing her anxieties, to alleviate
them. We walked for a few steps in
silence, and then my companion, in an
embarrassed tone, very different from
her ordinary manner, inquired,</p>

<p>&#8220;Mrs. Glenn, have you ever seen Mr.
Thurston when he has been here preaching
for Mr. Ryder?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Thurston,&#8221; I repeated; &#8220;is he
the home missionary stationed at M&mdash;&mdash;,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
among the mountains? If so, I have seen
him, and heard him preach; but why do
you ask that question?&#8221;</p>

<p>Strange to say, I had not a suspicion
of the state of affairs, notwithstanding
the confusion of my companion, for I had
never heard of the death of Mr. Thurston&#8217;s
wife, and therefore was not likely
to think of him in connection with Miss
Letty.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I only wanted to
know whether you had ever seen him,
and how you liked him, if you had; for
you see he has been over here several
times lately, and called on me with Mr.
Ryder, and&mdash;pshaw, how silly I am&mdash;well,
he has asked me to marry him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Letty actually blushed like a
young girl as she made this confession,
which took me so utterly by surprise,
that for a moment I had not a word to
say.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>&#8220;I see you are astonished at it, and no
wonder; I told him that everybody would
wonder that he should offer himself to me,
a seamstress, and without one cent of
money in the world; but he only smiled,
and said he wanted a wife for himself,
and not to suit the public; that he didn&#8217;t
want a young girl, nor a rich wife either,
to look down on him and his poor people.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are mistaken,&#8221; I replied; &#8220;it
isn&#8217;t that which surprised me, but I had
never heard that he was a widower; and
then the thought of losing you is something
so new, and not very pleasant, I
assure you. What shall we do without
you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought of that,&#8221; was the reply,
for Miss Letty had too much simplicity
of character to pretend to be ignorant of
her importance in the community, though
she was truly humble in her estimate of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
herself; &#8220;and I told Mr. Thurston I had
been here so long, and had got so into
the habit of doing every thing for everybody,
that I was afraid they&#8217;d miss me
a good deal. But he said if that was the
case, I was just the one for a poor minister,
who had to contrive to make ends
meet, and that his children needed me
more than the folks in Woodbury did.
You see he just brushed away all my objections
like so many cobwebs, so that I
couldn&#8217;t say another word.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am glad he seems to appreciate
your worth; if we must give you up, it
will be a comfort to know that you are
happy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, as to that I don&#8217;t know; I suppose
people at my age haven&#8217;t very romantic
notions of happiness; I&#8217;m sure I
haven&#8217;t; but if I can do any good to one
of the Lord&#8217;s servants, I shall be glad.
But when I think how much will be expected<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
of me, I am so frightened I feel
like giving it all right up. You see, when
I was a child they didn&#8217;t care much about
education in our town, and though I&#8217;ve
picked up some ideas here and there going
through the world, I don&#8217;t know very
much. Then I&#8217;m plain and homely in my
ways, and I&#8217;m afraid he&#8217;ll be ashamed
of me some time when he sees me by the
side of other ministers&#8217; wives; but when
I told him so he only laughed, and said
if that was all my difficulty, he should
look on it as settled; so I had to say yes,
for he wouldn&#8217;t hear to any thing else.&#8221;</p>

<p>I said every thing in my power to encourage
Miss Letty, for I felt that Mr.
Thurston had made a wise choice for himself
and his children, and that our little
seamstress, with her fund of good sense,
energy, and activity, and above all, with
her unwavering trust in God, would make
a far better wife for a clergyman than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
many an educated and refined woman
who was deficient in these qualities, as
too many are.</p>

<p>&#8220;And how soon are we to lose you?&#8221;
I inquired; &#8220;I trust not immediately;
you must give us a little time to become
reconciled to the thought of such a
change.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Thurston is very anxious that I
should go right away; he says he has
been alone so long, and his children need
me so much; but I told him I must see
to the work I had on hand, so as to leave
you all comfortable, or I shouldn&#8217;t be
easy in my mind about going. It&#8217;s hard
to leave such friends as I have got here,
and to go away from dear little Willie&#8217;s
grave too; but Mr. Ryder seems to think
it is my duty to go, because there are so
few that would be willing to take such a
place. I don&#8217;t see how that can be, for
I&#8217;m sure Mr. Thurston is one of the best<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
of men, and I think any woman might be
happy with him.&#8221;</p>

<p>From the earnestness with which this
was said, I saw that Miss Letty was really
interested in the good minister, and
not about to sacrifice herself from a sense
of duty merely; and I was glad to believe
this, for I feared she might not be
as comfortable under her new responsibilities
as she had been in Woodbury.</p>

<p>The wedding took place in church;
and after an hour or two spent at the
parsonage, where the friends of the bride
called to offer their congratulations and
to bid her good-by, the happy pair left
for their mountain home, from whence
we have repeatedly heard of the new
Mrs. Thurston, as useful and beloved
beyond any of her predecessors in that
place.</p>

<p>Mrs. Fenton had been for months rapidly
failing, and her symptoms were now<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
such as to indicate a speedy release from
her sufferings. She was intensely anxious
to see her long-absent son once more
on earth, and this strong maternal feeling
seemed actually to hold back the spirit,
already pluming its wings for flight. &#8220;I
shall not die till I have seen him again,&#8221;
was her constant reply to the inquiries
of her friends. &#8220;He will come in time
to receive my parting breath, and I am
content.&#8221;</p>

<p>Stanwood Fenton had never recovered
from the wound received at South Mountain,
and after months of terrible agony,
had recently been obliged to submit to
amputation of the hand as the only means
of saving his life. He was now recovering
slowly, and had been sent to the convalescent
camp, when a letter from Elinor
informed him of the condition of his
mother. In spite of the remonstrances
of his physicians he obtained, through<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
the influence of Col. Lester, a dismissal
from the camp, and started for home under
the care of Capt. May, a former member
of the Twenty-sixth, and now commander
of a company in Col. Lester&#8217;s
regiment, who had a furlough in consequence
of ill health.</p>

<p>Mrs. Fenton had seemed to be in a
dying state for several hours, but her
frequent inquiries showed us that she still
expected the arrival of her son, though
no word had reached her of his intention
to start for home.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is my only earthly care,&#8221; she said,
&#8220;and I think my Father will grant me
this request.&#8221;</p>

<p>She had been apparently sleeping, and
all was perfectly still in and around the
house, when suddenly starting and opening
her eyes, she exclaimed, &#8220;He is coming;
I hear the wheels; he is almost here;
thank God.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>None of us could hear a sound; but
the mother&#8217;s ears, quickened by affection,
caught the distant rumbling, though the
moment before death seemed about to
close them for ever. A few moments
brought the carriage to the door, and
Elinor and Lilian flew to meet and welcome
the returning wanderer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is my mother still living?&#8221; was his
first inquiry; and on receiving an answer
in the affirmative, the strength which had
sustained him on the way suddenly deserted
him. He sank into a chair, and
covering his face, gave way for a few
moments to the emotions which shook
his frame, while Elinor threw her arms
around his neck, and wept silently. But
Lilian, who knew the anxiety of her dying
aunt, said tenderly,</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear cousin, this will never do.
Think of your mother, whose life is now
counted by moments, and who is waiting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
for you. All your strength will be needed
for this interview, and you must be
calm, since agitation might be instantly
fatal to her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know it,&#8221; was his reply, &#8220;and you
shall see me a man again soon; but I
have feared the worst all the way home,
and the revulsion of feeling overcame
me at first. May you never know, dear
girls, what it is to have remorse added
to the sorrow of such an hour as this.&#8221;</p>

<p>The interview between the dying mother
and her erring, but penitent son, was
witnessed only by members of the family;
and at its close, she was so exhausted
as to be almost insensible. But the lamp
of life burned up brightly once more before
going out for ever. She bade us all
farewell, with a few tender and appropriate
words to each; then turning to her
son, who was kneeling at the bedside, with
his face buried in the pillows, she said,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
as she laid her cold hand upon his head,
&#8220;My dear boy, I once asked for you in
my blindness length of days and temporal
prosperity. Now I trust I have sought
better things of God for you; but you
must seek him for yourself, or you will never
see his face in peace. With my dying
breath I charge you, make it the business
of your life to meet me in heaven.&#8221;</p>

<p>After a few loving words to her husband,
Elinor, and Lilian, with a kind
message to Col. Lester, she said, in a
voice clear and distinct as in health,</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish to give it as my dying testimony
to all here present, that not one
good thing has ever failed in my experience,
of all that the Lord has spoken.
The religion of the Bible has been to me
an infinite blessing. I have lived on it
for years, and it has supported me in
suffering and sorrow, and now I am dying
in perfect peace; for Jesus is with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
me, and his rod and staff, they comfort
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her voice died away, but the smile on
her countenance was like the dawn of
heaven in its brightness; and it may
have been the reflection of that radiance,
for before her words had ceased to echo
in that hushed chamber, the spirit had
escaped from its wasted tenement, and
was already rejoicing before the throne
of God.</p>

<p>Col. Lester came home to see her buried,
but stayed only a few days, as active
service was soon expected. He was in
good health, and seemed very happy, and
as Lilian was to return with him to Washington,
there was nothing to mar her enjoyment
of his brief visit. After their
departure, Elinor and her brother were
very lonely, and Capt. May, whose leave
of absence had been extended, was a frequent
visitor at the Tyrrell House, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
a great favorite with all its inmates, from
Mr. Fenton down to Mammy Venus, and
Pete recently promoted to the dignity
of coachman.</p>

<p>To know Elinor Fenton intimately was
to love her, and the young soldier found,
before he had dreamed of danger, that
his heart was no longer in his own possession.
He could not with propriety
make known his feelings to Elinor so
soon after her bereavement, but from his
friend Stanwood he received all the encouragement
which a brother&#8217;s best wishes
could give; and when he rejoined his
regiment, he carried with him a hope
which brightened his darkest hours, and
made every hardship seem light.</p>

<p>Young Fenton had been at home but
a few months before he became a universal
favorite, as we discovered the acquisition
we had made in his society. He
was ardent, impulsive, and generous even<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
to a fault, and possessed the best traits
of Southern character, with an ingenuous
frankness peculiarly his own. Often led
astray by the warmth of his feelings, he
was quick to perceive and retract his
errors, and eager to make reparation for
them. It was impossible to associate with
Stanwood Fenton without being constantly
reminded of the Saviour&#8217;s remark
to the young man who came to him, and
who awoke so deep an interest in his benevolent
heart: &#8220;One thing thou lackest.&#8221;
Deep religious principle was the
one thing wanting in his character, the
balance-wheel without which his movements
were erratic and uncertain, guided
rather by the impulse of the moment
than by any sense of accountability to
God.</p>

<p>His original plan had been to enter the
Union army as soon as possible after the
death of his mother, but his health had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
suffered greatly from long confinement in
the hospital; and the loss of his hand,
together with the entreaties of his father
and sister, induced him to relinquish the
idea, and devote himself to the care of
his father&#8217;s business, which had suffered
from neglect. The light came back to
Elinor&#8217;s eye, and the bloom to her cheek,
as she saw her brother once more in his
proper place at home; and though her
beloved mother was still fondly remembered
and her loss deplored, it was with
a chastened sorrow, as she felt that for
her to die had been great gain.</p>

<p>Winter, with its storms and sunshine,
its triumphs and reverses, wore away at
length, and with the first blossoms of
May Lilian came back to us, more welcome
to our hearts than the breath of
spring or the fragrance of forest flowers.
She was accompanied by Captain, now
Major May, who was on the staff of Gen.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
Lester, and who eagerly availed himself
of an opportunity to revisit the spot
where his earthly hopes were centred.
During her stay at the head-quarters of
her husband, Lilian had learned to appreciate
the worth of the young <i>aide-de-camp</i>,
and ardently hoped he might be
successful in his suit. Why should I
narrate the progress of events? It was
the same old story repeated once again,
a tale as old as the history of the race,
yet new in the experience of every human
heart&mdash;the story of faithful love
meeting its reward at last in the affection
of the beloved object. As Elinor heard
from her cousin the recital of the gallant
exploits of Major May, of his courage and
devoted loyalty, she loved him not only
&#8220;for the perils he had passed,&#8221; but for
the high principle which had thus far
shielded him from the peculiar temptations
of a soldier&#8217;s life; and before his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
departure he won from her a promise,
that when the war was ended, or his
term of service expired, he might claim
his reward.</p>

<p>Months have passed, and still the cloud
of war overshadows the land, and still
our beloved ones are absent from us,
some with the heroic Sherman in Northern
Georgia, scaling the heights of Kennesaw
and Lookout mountains, and driving
the eagle from his eyrie, as they plant
the stars and stripes among the clouds;
some are in the sultry swamps and bayous
of Louisiana, exposed to a foe more
insidious and deadly than the rebel armies;
and others, among whom are our
best and bravest, are swelling the ranks
which threaten the Confederate capital.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">&#8220;The time has come when brothers must fight</div>
<div class="verse">And sisters must pray at home.&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>But while we look up to Him who
alone can send help and deliverance, it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
is our privilege to labor as well as to
pray, and while we wait upon God, to
watch for every opportunity of doing
whatever our hands find to do in the
good cause, with our whole heart.</p>

<p>The heavens are dark above us, and
the earth rocks wildly under our feet,
but God has a divine purpose underlying
all these convulsions, and it is fixed and
immutable as his throne. Faith sees in
the overturnings around us the majestic
march of his providence, preparing a
way in the tempest, and making the
wrath of man to praise him, while he
restrains the remainder thereof.</p>

<p>It is good for us sometimes, when hope
deferred makes the heart sick, to go back
to first principles, that we may gather
strength from a review of our past history
and of God&#8217;s dealings with us as a nation.</p>

<p>The American republic was unique in
its inception and establishment. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
pilgrim band who came to New England
in the Mayflower were not a company of
commercial adventurers, led hither by the
hope of gain; still less were they a party of
military freebooters, actuated by the lust
of conquest, like the Spaniards, who carried
fire and sword among the unoffending
inhabitants of Southern America.
The principle which led those noble men
and women to forsake kindred and home,
and to brave the perils of a howling wilderness,
and which sustained them amid
all their privations and sufferings, was
not earthly or perishable. It was the
burning, quenchless thirst for religious
liberty, the strong determination to worship
God according to the dictates of
their own conscience, though the roof of
their temple were the boundless sky and
their altar the rough stones of the forest,
that actuated the founders of this republic
in their sublime enterprise.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>They came to these wilds of nature
that they might found a colony and build
up a church, and advance the interests
of the Redeemer&#8217;s kingdom, and serve
as stepping-stones to others in the great
work of human progress. And never
has the divine declaration, &#8220;Them that
honor me I will honor,&#8221; been more signally
fulfilled than in the growth of the
infant nation thus established. Every
step of the way in which, as a people,
we have been led, from the landing on
Plymouth rock to the proud position
which we have hitherto occupied among
the nations, has been marked by special
interpositions of Providence, no less real,
though less miraculous, than the pillar of
cloud and flame which guided the ancient
Israelites to the land of promise.</p>

<p>But in our prosperity we have forgotten
the Rock whence we were hewn, and
have rebelled against our father&#8217;s God,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
and refused to obey his commands, until
in his righteous indignation he has come
out in judgment against us, and left us to
our own ways and to eat the fruit of our
own devices. As a nation we have
deeply sinned. As a nation we are suffering
a fearful punishment.</p>

<p>But let not the enemies of liberty in
the old world or the new, exult in the
belief that the republic is about to be
rent in fragments, and the last hope of
the oppressed millions of Europe to be
for ever entombed. We are bearing the
indignation of the Lord because we have
sinned against him; but when his purposes
concerning us are accomplished,
he will arise to execute judgment for
us.</p>

<p>No careful observer of God&#8217;s providence
can doubt that he has reserved
America for a grand destiny&mdash;that our
country has a mission to perform of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
sublimest import, and a grand agency to
exert in the regeneration of the world.</p>

<p>If we read aright the divine purpose
in reference to this nation, and the historical
causes here concentrating, we
must believe that the vital forces inherent
in our government and institutions
will, with the blessing of God, master all
the antagonisms now threatening their
overthrow; and that, having passed
through this baptism of blood and fire,
we shall emerge cleansed and purified,
and stand as a beacon light to the struggling
nations of the old world, until suffering
humanity everywhere, regenerated
and redeemed, shall rejoice in one
grand jubilee of liberty, Christianity,
and universal brotherhood.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away&#8212;you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the

        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

        &#8226; You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
